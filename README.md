# SimonSays

A plugin designed to allow syncing of emotes between clients.

## What? How?

* Simon Says uses the game chat to listen for valid emote strings that follow a configurable catchphrase.
    * Simon Says will check only for emotes, I don't intend to add the ability to send all commands.
    * Simon Says will, on recieving  valid emote, instantly push that emote as a valid command to chat.
