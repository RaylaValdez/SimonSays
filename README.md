# SimonSays

A plugin designed to allow syncing of emotes between clients.

## What? How?

* Simon Says uses the game chat to listen for valid emote strings that follow a configurable catchphrase.
* Simon Says will check only for emotes, I don't intend to add the ability to send all commands.
* Simon Says will, on recieving  valid emote, instantly push that emote as a valid command to chat.

## Features
* Emote Commanding - Much like PuppetMaster, with expanded configuration.
* Emote Syncing - Syncing emotes with another person or persons, depending on configuration.
* Positional Sync - Sync your position with another person.
* Postional Offsets - Apply custom offsets for certain emotes.
